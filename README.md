Multi-agent systems collaborate to handle tasks like summarization, article writing, and PHI redaction.



# Architecture of the System
- Components:
-  Frontend: Streamlit for user interaction.
- Agents:
1. Main Agents: Perform core tasks like summarization, writing, and redaction.
2. Validator Agents: Validate outputs for quality and accuracy.
3. Agent Manager: Coordinates agents.
- Logger: Tracks interactions for debugging.
